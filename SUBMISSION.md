# Submission

Keep this tight. Bullet points are fine. We read this before we read your code,
and a clear account of your reasoning carries real weight — including where you
chose not to do something.

## Video walkthrough

Paste your Loom (or equivalent) link here. 5–10 minutes.

## How to run it

Anything we need to know beyond `npm install && npm run dev`.

## Time spent

Roughly, and how you split it.

## Baseline defects found

| # | Defect | Where | Fixed / left / out of scope |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | Bulk update sends >50 ids in one call, rejected by API with 400 `too_many_ids` | `client.ts`, `App.tsx` | Fixed (chunked into batches of <= 50 with bounded concurrency) |
| 2 | Search input fires on every keystroke without debouncing, easily tripping the 80 req / 10s rate limit | `App.tsx`, `useDebounce.ts` | Fixed (300ms debounce via `useDebounce`) |
| 3 | Out-of-order API responses cause race conditions where slower short-prefix responses overwrite newer search results | `useAssets.ts`, `client.ts` | Fixed (`AbortController` signal passed and aborted on query change) |
| 4 | | | |

## Key decisions

For each significant choice: what you did, what you rejected, and why. Three to
six of these is about right.

**Data fetching and caching**

**Stale response handling**

**Virtualization approach**

**Optimistic updates and rollback**

**Retry and backoff policy**

**State placement and URL sync**

## Performance

Fill in real measurements, not estimates. Say which machine and browser.

| Metric | Before | After | How measured |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Rendered DOM nodes at 5,000 rows loaded | | | |
| Cards re-rendered when toggling one selection | | | |
| Longest task during sustained scroll | | | |
| Requests fired while typing a 6-character query | | | |
| Production bundle, gzipped | | | |

What was the actual bottleneck, and how did you find it?

---

## Accessibility

- Keyboard model you implemented, in one paragraph.
- How you tested it, including any screen reader.
- Known gaps.

---

## Interface decisions

Three or four sentences: what you were optimising for, and the decisions that
follow from it. Then briefly:

- **Visual system.** Your colour, spacing and type decisions, and where they live.
- **Status treatment.** How the four statuses read as a progression, and how they
  stay distinguishable without relying on colour.
- **States.** What you did with loading, empty, error, offline and partial
  failure.
- **Contrast.** What you checked against, and with what.
- **Copy.** Any user-facing message you rewrote and why.

## Trade-offs and cuts

What you deliberately did not do, and what you would do with another day.

## Critique of the API

What you would change about the backend contract, and what it forced you to do in
the client that you would rather not have.

## Anything you would like us to look at

Code you are proud of, or a decision you are unsure about and want to discuss.
